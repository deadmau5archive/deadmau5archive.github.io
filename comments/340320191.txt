This is a feature available on Kepler (Geforce 600+, Quadro K series+) or newer Nvidia GPUs. This feature allows for arbitrary textures to be applied to instances. The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the \"Instance Textures\" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel c"}],"n":"jblatta","b":[{"i":"subscriber","v":"0"},{"i":"premium","v":"1"}]},{"t":6291.997,"c":[{"a":"mrfunk2Hacker","e":"941645"},{"t":" "},{"a":"mrfunk2Au","e":"1299794"},{"t":" "},{"a":"mrfunk2Au","e":"1299794"}],"n":"mrfunkyjar","b":[{"i":"partner","v":"1"}],"s":"4864C0"},{"t":6311.07,"c":[{"t":"!uptime"}],"n":"erikbonoller","b":[{"i":"premium","v":"1"}]},{"t":6311.391,"c":[{"t":"deadmau5 has been live for 1 hour 45 minutes 22 seconds "},{"a":"mau5Cheese","e":"66564"}],"n":"Nightbot","b":[{"i":"moderator","v":"1"},{"i":"subscriber","v":"0"},{"i":"partner","v":"1"}],"s":"7C7CE1"},{"t":6332.744,"c":[{"t":"@deadmau5 that is talking about the instance textures par"}],"n":"jblatta","b":[{"i":"subscriber","v":"0"},{"i":"premium","v":"1"}]},{"t":6378.821,"c":[{"t":"Can you make a separate instance for the colors?"}],"n":"WarlordFour20","b":[{"i":"premium","v":"1"}],"s":"1E90FF"},{"t":6386.023,"c":[{"t":"@deadmau5 getting there I think, I think you need an array of textures or a 3D texture top, then use index to pick which one"}],"n":"jblatta","b":[{"i":"subscriber","v":"0"},{"i":"premium","v":"1"}]},{"t":6398.55,"c":[{"t":"Joel,, can you make the cubes twirl like spiral wise?"}],"n":"captaintrill108","b":[{"i":"premium","v":"1"}]},{"t":6404.42,"c":[{"t":"??? multiple color nodes into a mixer node ???"}],"n":"Wolfman1469","s":"5F9EA0"},{"t":6410.345,"c":[{"t":"At least im on the same page cause I have no idea whats going on lol"}],"n":"WarlordFour20","b":[{"i":"premium","v":"1"}],"s":"1E90FF"},{"t":6421.579,"c":[{"t":"pattern chop with ramp"}],"n":"paketa12"},{"t":6425.795,"c":[{"t":"@deadmau5 just based on row number"}],"n":"jblatta","b":[{"i":"subscriber","v":"0"},{"i":"premium","v":"1"}]},{"t":6425.974,"c":[{"t":"this looks pretty fun to do "},{"a":":o","e":"8"}],"n":"Slemsvamp","s":"009DA8"},{"t":6445.357,"c":[{"t":"@WarlordFour20 haha, i thought you were about to step in with some wise shit then"}],"n":"richjoke","s":"ED1075"},{"t":6447.193,"c":[{"t":"I wanna see a song where you push the energy like Danger does in 1:*** wobble that energy but ive never seen it come in one rise.
